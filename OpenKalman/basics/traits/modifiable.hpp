   * \brief Specifies that U is not obviously incompatible with T, such that assigning U to T might be possible.
   * \details The result is true unless there is an incompatibility of some kind that would prevent assignment.
   * Examples of such incompatibility are if T is constant or has a nested constant type, if T and U have a
   * different shape or scalar type, or if T and U differ as to being self-adjoint, triangular, diagonal,
   * zero, or identity. Even if this concept is true, a compile-time error is still possible.
